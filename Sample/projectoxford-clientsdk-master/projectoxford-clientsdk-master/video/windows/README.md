The client library
==================

The Video API client library is a thin C\# client wrapper for Microsoft Cognitive Services (formerly Project Oxford) Video
REST APIs.  

The sample
==========

This sample is a Windows WPF application to demonstrate the use of Video API.

It demonstrates Video API by specifying a local video file.

Build the sample
----------------

1.  Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 and select File \> Open \>
    Project/Solution.

2.  Starting in the folder where you clone the repository, go to Video \> Windows
    \> Sample-WPF Folder.

3.  Double-click the Visual Studio 2015 Solution (.sln) file
    VideoAPI-WPF-Samples.

4.  Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select Build \> Build Solution.

Run the sample
--------------

After the build is complete, press F5 to run the sample.

First, you must obtain a Video API subscription key by following instructions in [Microsoft Cognitive Services subscription](<https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up>).

Locate the text edit box saying "Paste your subscription key here to start" on
the top right corner. Paste your subscription key. You can choose to persist
your subscription key in your machine by clicking "Save Key" button. When you
want to delete the subscription key from the machine, click "Delete Key" to
remove it from your machine.

Click on "Select Scenario" to use samples of different scenarios, and
follow the instructions on screen.

Microsoft will receive the videos you upload and may use them to improve Video
API and related services. By submitting a video, you confirm you have consent
from everyone in it.
